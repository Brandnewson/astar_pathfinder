<h1>Pygame A-star pathfinder visualiser</h1>

<h2> Ambition: </h2>
I was curious about how the algorithms behind the minds of our computer worked. This is my first step into finding out about algorithms.

<h2> Method: </h2>

Utilising the pygame module in Python, I managed to easily visualise how the A-star algorithm worked.
The program has 4 functions:

- Set point A
- Set point B
- Set up "walls" for the algorithm to figure its way around
- Execute the A-star algorithm
